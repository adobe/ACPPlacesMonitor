#### Open the Xcode workspace
You can open the workspace in Xcode by running the following command:
~~~
make open
~~~

#### Development setup
Prerequisites:
- [Environment Setup](#environment-setup)
- [Open the Xcode workspace](#open-the-xcode-workspace)

You can build the Places Monitor library by selecting the scheme called `ACPPlacesMonitor_iOS`.  All source code for the monitor can be found in the `ACPPlacesMonitor` group of the solution navigator.  The source itself lives in the [code/src/](https://git.corp.adobe.com/dms-mobile/bourbon-platform-ios-places-monitor/tree/dev/code/src) directory.

- On the simulator, you will be spoofing the location using our `.gpx` files.  In the menu for the debug area in Xcode, hit the "simulate location" button to toggle between `AdobeSanJose` and `Safeway-SantaClara` locations. <br><br>
